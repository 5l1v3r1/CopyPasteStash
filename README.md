# CopyPasteStash

I copy/paste the same things a lot. Why not take all the common strings I copy/paste, put them into a hashmap, and throw a UI on top of it with autocomplete? That's the goal of this project: a stash of strings I copy/paste a lot with a nice quick keyboard shortcut driven way to look them up.
